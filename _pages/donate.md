## AIM

On this platform, I hope to create tutorial series as well as practical DIY projects with Embedded hardware such as the Arduino (AVR Series), ARM (Cortex M3/M4 Series), ESP8266/ESP32 devices, Raspberry Pi /Beaglebone and many more.

Projects and tutorials would be a beginner to an intermediate level so that everyone can follow along with my series.

I aim to create tutorial series on:
- FreeRTOS, ROS, Network Protocols (HTTP/MQTT), Circuit design using KiCAD, with emphasis on practical knowledge.

My projects would be related to topics that have little to no pre-requisites.

## CONTRIBUTION

All my tutorials and projects will be documented on [My Website](https://coder137.github.io) and my [Github repository](https://github.com/coder137).

However, most tutorials and projects require peripheral hardware. I also plan to create a video series on youtube once the backing crosses a minimum amount (200-300 USD) for the video related hardware.

For users interested in supporting you can contribute to either my Patreon or PayPal.
Users can also support me by sharing my tutorials and projects with like-minded individuals interested in such niche topics.
